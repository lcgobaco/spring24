Please refer to the Lab 2 requirements.

1) Implement a class Course that contains the following fields and all the common overloading operators - okay

2) Implement the class template class ArrayList that holds the collection of data (-5) - You did not use ArrayList template as in the requirements - Use of vector was not the requirement!

8) Your main.cpp (-5) - Your program looked like a procedure program.

As I indicated in class and lab 2 template, your main should be like,
int main() { StudentFortfolio main_menu; main_menu.activate(); }
- Remember that we are learning OOP and data structures.
