Programming with Data Structures
This course involves the study and implementation of data structure programming\
techniques. The emphasis is on the data structures of stacks, queues, lists, trees, and hash\
tables; the use of recursion; and the application of these tools primarily to searching and\
sorting. Students implement these concepts by writing programs in an object-oriented\
language such as C++.
