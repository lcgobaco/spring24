You have a lot of missing requirements.
Please study for your final exam and complete Lab 5
. Depending on how you do on the final exam, I will re-evaluate for your final points.

(5/8/2024): I did have some good implementation, like using the comparator for sorting. +10
New score: 15 New scores: 15.
1) main.cpp, it should be what I have talked about in class
Example: int main() { ContactMenu t1; t1.get_input(); return 0; }
2) Your class Contact was missing the required operators.
Your linkedlist will not work.
- Please see your Canvas Discussions for Lab 3 template.

3) With LinkedList, you need to implement all the necessary data, methods,
and operators.
Otherwise, your program will not work. Missing requirements.
Please see Lab 3 requirements

4) Move operations, It should be,
// prefix increment Iterator<T>& operator++()
// postfix increment Iterator<T> operator++(T)
// prefix decrement Iterator<T>& operator--()
// postfix decrement Iterator<T> operator--(T)

Example:

void ContactMenu::move_first() { it = list.begin(); } v

void ContactMenu::move_next() { ++it; }

void ContactMenu::move_previous() { --it; }

void ContactMenu::move_last() { it = list.end(); }

5) Implement the following operations for your ContactList

6) Missing the selectionSort
You did not do the selectionSort as I discussed in class.
